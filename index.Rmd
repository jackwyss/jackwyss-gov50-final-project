## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to movie sequels. I found an interesting data set that catalogs several different movies, their sequels, and the IMDb rating for each. I am working on a research question that deals with the correlation between the IMDb score of the first movie in the franchise and that of its sequels. With regression, I would predict what the IMDb score (audience reception) of each successive sequel would be given the IMDb score of the original or something similar. I think this would be a fun and unique project.
